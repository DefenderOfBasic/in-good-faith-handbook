"Why bother arguing about politics? nobody ever changes their mind!" all my friends keep saying this but damnit it's literally objectively not true. please stop repeating this. 

I have a process for how to change anybody's mind about anything. Here it is:

How to change anybody's mind about anything:

- Understand the territory 
- Understand their map
- \<make it emotionally safe for them to change their mind\>
- Find insightful examples of their map not matching the territory that they know

I used to skip the "emotionally safe" part. And I got very confusing results. Sometimes people change their minds, sometimes it backfires and it's worse.  

Nobody is going to change their mind if it is not emotionally safe to do so, and that is NOT irrational

I'm not talking about bruising egos or whatever (although that is a factor). I'm talking about: if changing your mind on issue X is going to reframe you from "good person" to "bad person", in your mind, and in your loved one's minds. Then it's a terrible idea to change your mind

This is what actually makes this hard. I can't make it emotionally safe for people to change their minds on the internet. But I can do:

(1) Do this for my friends
(2) on the internet, I can detect this, and not push them. I focus on the ones who feel this safety
