"Could I be wrong here?"

Easy to convince yourself of your own correctness, in particular if you're seeing and/or have seen people making significant errors in understanding.

However! Convincing someone to change their mind by explaining to them how the system actually works - by building your (correct) belief chain - works so vanishingly rarely that you might as well consider it impossible.

Even if you are correct, fuzzing a little into "maybe I'm wrong here, let's try to figure this out together" helps put you into a frame of mind where you can work with the other person to walk the belief chain together.

"Let's walk through this and check that this all makes sense" is asking for help (ish?) and can (maybe) defuse things.
