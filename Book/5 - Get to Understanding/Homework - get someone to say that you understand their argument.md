i haven't had the energy for internet arguments in a while, but I kinda miss it (I haven't been scrolling the TL much)

here's my strategy in case you wanna try it and report back, feel free to DM:

1. find a spicy tweet, something going viral, topical, heated, political, etc
2. do NOT respond to the OP, just scroll down until you see someone with a (1) crazy opinion that you disagree with (2) a lot of anger
3. you want someone with NOT a ton of followers. that means they're replying because they care about the issue. they're a real person who feels strongly here
4. ask them a question. you CANNOT go in telling them why they're wrong or what you think. That has never ever worked. You need to signal that you're here to understand (because you are)
5. repeat their position back to them, ideally they confirm it
6. 6. now's the tricky part, you have to get them to understand you, but you can't do it by telling them the thing. you have to ask them a question whose *answer* reveals your conclusion 

this is the only way

i repeat: you cannot just tell them the thing. you can't tell anyone anything. you can only (1) understand where they're at (2) ask them questions to help them see the truth for themselves
