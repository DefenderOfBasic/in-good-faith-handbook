Hey! I'm so glad you came to look at how you could contribute! We would love your help building this book, including feedback, criticisms, related ideas, pieces you've written, and more.

We're building this book using Git and hosted on GitHub. Git is typically used for collaborating on software development (and was built to coordinate the development of Linux), so it has some powerful but confusing features that might be unfamiliar to folks who haven't used it before. (And to folks who have tbh, including me lol.)

We're here to help make sure your voice gets into the conversation, so please ping us if you're stuck!

Here are a couple ways you could contribute:

# Add and edit via fork and pull request

For those familiar with Git and GitHub, you can fork the repo, make your changes, then create a pull request to merge your changes back into the main repo.

Get stuck? Ping us above! We're happy to help.

# Open an Issue
You can also open an issue to discuss things in the repo. Put whatever you like in there and we can handle integrating it.
