From [this thread](https://x.com/DefenderOfBasic/status/1825523348216152136?t=KdTSxWTx8jZ7MuigBX1g7A&s=19):

the reason I've never lost an Internet argument is because I understand there is a bronze, silver, and gold medal 

ðŸ¥‡convince the other guy 
ðŸ¥ˆget the other guy to understand you
ðŸ¥‰ understand the other guy 

I always go for ðŸ¥‰first

A lot of arguments completely fail because they're going for gold, and can't even get bronze

I've bootstrapped this. I get bronze with one guy. Then weeks later I meet someone else with the same position, I go for silver

once you get to silver, it's your best fighting chance ðŸ¥‡
