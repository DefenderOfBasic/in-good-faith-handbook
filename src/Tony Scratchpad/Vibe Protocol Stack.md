There's an analogy between conversation vibe management and the computer networking OSI protocol stack.

First, a quick overview of the OSI protocol stack model. It's a way of thinking about how systems on the internet connect by 

If you turn on the WiFi on your phone and try to connect the internet, (TODO: Explanation of the OSI protocol model? Key idea is this zippering of protocols connecting to carry the high-level info, and if something goes wrong lower like a microwave interfering w wifi or a router expiring your DHCP lease then high-level stuff breaks)

Like, underneath any communication is body language - am I in danger?

I don't know quite how it stacks up but it feels something like:
0. Body language (danger)
1. Respect (status risk)
2. Trust?
3. Goal alignment
4. Shared facts
5. Interpretation / belief tree
6. Conclusion

Issues lower down in the stack can be tricky to detect if you're trying to have high-level "what should we do" conversations. In particular, I find that feeling physically shitty messes up the body language & lower levels.

I think this is part of why gentle questioning works so well and hard-charging inquisition / "you're wrong" fails - causes issues lower down in the protocol stack

> Important to have a gentle and unprepossessing disposition if youâ€™re going to ask questions, otherwise it comes off as aggressive. And important to ask a lot of questions to provoke thinking.

Small talk can be seen as channel setup and parameter negotiation in the vibe stack.
