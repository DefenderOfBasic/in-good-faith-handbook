# Contributors

This work would truly not be possible without the hundreds of contributors around the world. I rely a lot on arguing with internet strangers to craft this theory, I appreciate every single person I've interacted with for contributing valuable data.

This is a list of people who I regularly go to for feedback or whose ideas have shaped mine.

- @KompendiumProj, on vibe translation
- @workflowsauce, building LLM tools to help with translation
- @bistromathmagic, @baoteching, @blublairies understands the theory 
- @tonyaajjackson, understands technology & people
- @Aron_Adler, for testing my theories & providing critical feedback
- @giggleskwelch, for bravely testing these theories in the wild

TODO: add Nathan Young as inspiration? He has a number of articles about having better discourse. And James Rosen-Birch, just for modeling being measured & nuance, fighting for good & truth without despair.
